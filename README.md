# Landing-Page
This is my first project with full autonomy, it include multiple concept as : 
    - HTML (header, images, links, div and text)
    - CSS
    - flexbox
    - header, footer and core (holy gail layout)
There is no AI generation for this code. I wanted to do all of this pages by myself.
